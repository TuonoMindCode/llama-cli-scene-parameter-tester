Write a single, self-contained novel scene (at least 4000 words) in third-person limited from the perspective of Mara, a 34-year-old paramedic who is off-duty for the first time in weeks.

Setting: a small coastal town in late autumn. It’s evening, windy, and the power has been flickering. Mara stops at a nearly empty diner near the harbor to eat and decompress. She intends to be anonymous.

Scene goals:
- Make the diner feel real: layout, smells, sounds, weather pressing against the windows, small town details.
- Introduce at least two other characters (a diner worker and a patron) with distinct voices and private motives.
- Give Mara a quiet internal thread (fatigue, guilt, tenderness, or something she’s avoiding thinking about).
- A problem begins subtle and becomes unavoidable: it can be social, moral, or situational (not necessarily a medical emergency), but it should escalate across the scene.
- Include dialogue with subtext, interruptions, and little tells.
- No supernatural elements. Keep it plausible and grounded.

Plot seed (use but don’t rush):
Mara notices a kid in the corner booth who keeps checking the door like they’re waiting for someone who isn’t coming. The kid has a backpack that looks packed too carefully for a normal school day. Mara tries not to intervene, then fails at that.

End the scene on a hook: Mara has to decide something or act, and it will change her night.
